# Mod Build Manifest File Documentation

:::info

The `build.txt` file has been around for quite some time, but may be reaching its end-of-life shortly (see: [TML-2472](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/pull/2472)).

:::

The Mod Build Manifest file format is used for defining mod properties (mostly build properties). The `build.txt` file laying in the root folder of your mod is the only file that uses this format.

<!--
## Early History

Recorded below is a brief history of data before the `build.txt` file was introduced, and how it worked when it was first introduced.

### v0.1.0

Prior to a manifest file, the [`Terraria.ModLoader.Mod`](/docs/tmodloader/asm/terraria/modloader/mod) class had a `Name`, `Version`, and `Author` property (all of which being `string`s).

### v0.3.0

Instead of managing values in your mod's main class, `build.txt` was added with only five fields:

- `dllReferences`
- `modReferences`
- `author`
- `version`
- `displayName`

It was very primitive in its original conception; little has changed regarding how data is loaded, and it has pretty much only grown since v0.3.0.

## File Format

Mod Build Manifest files use properties represented as key-value pairs. Keys are the property names, and values are strings of text. There are several property types:

- `single`, a single value, represented as `yourKey = your value here`.
- `boolean`, a `single` which evaluates to `true` if the value is "`true`" (case-insensitive), otherwise evauluates to "`false`". Represented as `yourKey = true` (and `yourKey = false` or anything else not case-insensitively equal to `true`).
- `version`, a `single` value which has two to four "elements". Each "element" must be a positive integer that can go up to [`int.MaxValue`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.int32.maxvalue?view=net-6.0). Represented as `x.x`, `x.x.x`, or `x.x.x.x`. Each "element" is separated by a period (`.`). Represented as `yourKey = 1.2.3.4` (or any aforementioned variation).
- `side`, represents a [`Terraria.ModLoader.ModSide], can only be `Both`, `Client`, `Server`, or `NoSync`. Represented as `yourKey = SideGoesHere` (`yourKey = Both`, `yourKey = Client`, `yourKey = Server`, `yourKey = NoSync`).
- `array`, an array of elements. Elements are separated using a comma (`,`), and any element may have trailing spaces (` `) as they are trimmed after being split. Represented as `yourKey = element1, element2, element3, ...`.

Every key is case-sensitive, but keys just need their expected value.
