# Decription File Documentation

A description file lies at the root folder of every mod, similarly to the [`build.txt` file](/docs/tmodloader/files/build).

The description file is a raw text file with chat tag capabilities. You should only use vanilla chat tags since users can see a mod's description both on the Mod Browser and in the Mods List, meaning there is no guarantee that your mod will be loaded when they see it.

The description file should be used for giving a brief overview of what your mod does and/or adds. It should be relatively short and to the point. It is also useful for providing contact information, social links, other forms of redirections, and more.
