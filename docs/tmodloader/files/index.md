# File Formats

Both tModLoader and Terraria make use of various file formats to serialize and deserialize data.

## Terraria

Terraria makes use of various XNA content pipeline formats and custom formats for managing data, including worlds, players, achievements, and more.

## tModLoader

tModLoader brings in several of its own custom formats for handling mods and modded data. Some files pair up with vanilla files, and some stand alone by themselves.
