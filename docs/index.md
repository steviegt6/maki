# Welcome

Hello, and welcome. This is [my](https://github.com/steviegt6) documentation site, which essentially functions as a wiki. The contents of this website are completely open-source [here](https://github.com/steviegt6/maki), where I encourage you to contribute anything and everything you feel is reasonable to include here. The content featured here is first and foremost written in English, as it is my native tongue. Any translations are welcome, but I will not be able to maintain them myselfâ€”others will need to ensure their relevancy and correctness.

## Content

Various categories of information are encompassed within this wiki. I use it to house documentation for personal projects, modding, and other things I find interesting. Notably, I also use this site to [document tModLoader and Terraria](/docs/tmodloader/) for modders.
